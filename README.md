=======
Extract this .zip to "programfiles(x86)/steam/steamapps/common/teamfortress2/tf/custom"
If it doesn't work and you don't know how to install huds and find a solution, just make sure that the "scripts" and "resource" folders are extracted to a clean folder, then put that folder containing both subfolders into your tf/custom directory.
Enjoy!
